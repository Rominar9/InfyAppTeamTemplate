    </p>

    <h3>Theme Implementation</h3>
    <p>
      Our theme is nutrition—empowering people to take charge of their health through smart, intentional food choices. Rather than letting unhealthy habits take the lead, FoodTube 
      equips users with the tools to cook nutritious meals, discover fresh ingredients nearby, and make better eating decisions every day. No matter your experience in the kitchen, FoodTube 
      helps you build lasting habits that support a healthier lifestyle. This isn't just about food—it's about taking control of your health, one meal at a time.
    </p>

    <h3>Why We Built This</h3>
    <p>
      We believe that good nutrition should be accessible, enjoyable, and empowering. Too many people struggle with knowing what to cook, how to cook it, or 
      where to find the right ingredients. We’re creating this app to simplify that journey—giving people the tools to learn healthy cooking, discover nearby 
      food resources, and build lifelong habits that support their well-being. Whether you’re taking your first steps in the kitchen or trying to eat better on 
      a busy schedule, this app is here to guide, support, and inspire you—every meal, every day.
